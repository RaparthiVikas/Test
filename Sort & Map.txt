3Q: difference between sort method and map method

sort() method
1. Used to sort the elements of an array in place
2. Mutates the original array. The original array is modified
3. Returns the sorted array (the original array, now sorted)
4. array.sort([compareFunction])
5. The optional compareFunction defines the sort order
6. Can be chained with other array methods, such as map(), to perform multiple operations
7. The time complexity of the sort() method depends on the implementation, but it's generally O(n log n)
8. Useful for sorting elements in an array based on a specific order or comparison function

map() method
1. Used to transform each element of an array and create a new array
2. Does not mutate the original array. It returns a new array
3. Returns a new array with the transformed elements
4. array.map(callback(currentValue, index, array), thisArg)
5. The callback function transforms each element and returns the new value
6. Can also be chained with other array methods, such as sort(), to perform multiple operations
7. The time complexity of the map() method is O(n), as it iterates through the entire array
8. Useful for transforming each element of an array into a new value, creating a new array
